Neural Network XOR example

2 Inputs => 3 Hidden => 1 Output

Fully connected network.  The initial weights are set randomly but the random seed is set to 1.0 so that we will receive the same results every time for testing.

Example Output:
[1.00, 1.00] ==> [0.0067] Error 0.67%
[0.00, 1.00] ==> [0.9797] Error 2.03%
[0.00, 0.00] ==> [0.0333] Error 3.33%
[1.00, 0.00] ==> [0.9797] Error 2.03%
